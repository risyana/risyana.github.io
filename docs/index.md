Hi! I’m Eka Risyana, a frontend developer with 6+ years of experience building clean, responsive, and maintainable interfaces.

My main expertise is in Vue.js, but I’m always eager to explore and adapt to new tools or frameworks when projects require it. I’ve worked in both large companies and fast-moving startups, which gave me a balance of structured practices and agile problem-solving.

Currently, I’m part of the frontend team at Mekari, where I help build features for Talenta. I enjoy collaborating with product and design teams, turning ideas into user-friendly solutions, and continuously learning along the way.
