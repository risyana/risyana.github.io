Hi! I’m Eka Risyana, a frontend developer. 

I started my career working with ERP systems, and over time, I shifted my focus to frontend development—especially with Vue.js, which has been my main toolkit in recent years.

I’ve worked in both large companies and fast-moving startups, which gave me a good mix of structure and flexibility. I enjoy turning designs into clean, responsive interfaces, collaborating with product and design teams, and writing code that’s easy to maintain (and hopefully pleasant to read).

Right now, I’m part of the frontend team at Mekari, where I help build features for Talenta. I love working with good people, solving real problems, and learning something new along the way.
